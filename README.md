## Building from source
Here is how to build starcheat from source. Make sure everything in the dependencies section is installed before you do a build.

### Dependencies
- [Python 3.3+](http://www.python.org/getit/)
- [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)
- [Qt 5](http://qt-project.org/downloads) (included in PyQt5 binaries on Windows)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/)
- [py-starbound](https://github.com/blixt/py-starbound)

**NOTE:** py-starbound is included as a [git submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) and needs to be cloned with the following commands:

- ```cd <starcheat top folder>```
- ```git submodule sync```
- ```git submodule update --init```

Applications such as [Sourcetree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) should offer to clone it automatically.

### Windows
Lines starting with ```>``` can be run in PowerShell or cmd.exe.

- ```> cd <starcheat top folder>```
- ```> C:\Python33\python.exe .\build.py```
- Browse to newly created ```build\``` folder
- Double click ```starcheat.py```

#### Standalone Build
The standalone build makes an executable which includes all Python and Qt dependencies.

- Install [cx_freeze](http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/)
- ```> cd <starcheat top folder>```
